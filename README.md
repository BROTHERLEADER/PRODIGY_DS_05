## Data Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes the following visualizations:

Number of Accidents by Hour of the Day:

Visualizes the distribution of accidents across different hours of the day.
Number of Accidents by Weather Conditions:

Shows the distribution of accidents under various weather conditions.


Accident Severity Distribution:

Illustrates the severity of accidents.
Number of Accidents by Day of the Week:

Depicts the distribution of accidents across different days of the week.


## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into traffic accidents by examining the impact of various factors such as time, weather, and road conditions. The visualizations help in understanding the patterns and can be used for improving road safety measures.
