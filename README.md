# Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Objective

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis can be found here.


# Steps Performed

Data Loading: Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Cleaning: Checked for and handled missing values.

Data Exploration: Explored the data to understand distributions and relationships.

Data Visualization: Visualized the distribution of accidents by road conditions, weather conditions, and time of day.
Created a heatmap to identify accident hotspots based on location data.

## Visualizations

Distribution of Accidents by Road Conditions: Count plot showing the number of accidents under different road conditions.

Distribution of Accidents by Weather Conditions: Count plot showing the number of accidents under different weather conditions.

Distribution of Accidents by Time of Day: Count plot showing the number of accidents at different times of the day
